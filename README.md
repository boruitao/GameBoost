#### The rule: 
The player controls the movement of the rocket and takes the rocket from the blue launching pad to the green landing pad. 
The rocket is free to touch the red brick but if it collides any other bricks, it explodes and the game restarts at the last level. 

Keyboard controller: 
 * Space key: boost the rocket
 * A: turn left
 * D: turn right
